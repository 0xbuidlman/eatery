#Development

## Dependency management
Currently we use four third party libraries (found in the `vendor` directory).  For now, we will just copy and paste them into our project to update.  This obviously isn't very scalable but for the short-term, it will drastically decrease the number of build errors in development.

## Architecture
[coming soon]
